n8n Workflow Generator Chrome Extension
Overview
This Chrome extension allows users to automatically generate complete n8n workflows from a single plain text prompt using an AI language model (from OpenRouter) and assists in automating workflow creation for any task.

The generated workflow is returned as JSON and automatically copied to your clipboard for easy import into your n8n instance.

You can build complex automation workflows quickly—no manual drag-and-drop required.

Features
Input a plain-text description of the automation you want.

Uses a powerful LLM (OpenRouter DeepSeek R1) to generate fully functional n8n workflows.

Outputs native n8n workflow JSON copied directly to your clipboard.

Supports Gmail email classification automation as an example use case.

Simple, user-friendly interface as a Chrome extension popup.

How it Works
User opens the extension and types their workflow description as a text prompt.

The prompt is sent to OpenRouter’s AI model which returns the n8n workflow JSON.

The JSON is automatically copied to the clipboard.

The user can then paste/import the workflow inside their n8n editor.

The generated n8n workflow is fully-formed and ready to run.
